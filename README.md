## For Android everything should work correctly

## For Ios it is missing ForegroundActivity service so it won't work unless we comment out files inside ForegroundManagerService

### HOW TO LAUNCH

1. npm install
2. npm run prebuild (for android, for ios we need to update package.json)
3. npm run android

### TODO

1. Add Foreground Activity in Swift to ios
2. Update Kotlin Foreground Activity for something more fancy with buttons and progress
